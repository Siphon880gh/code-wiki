A function signature, also known as a type or method signature, describes the input and output of a function or method. It's made up of the following information:
- **Parameters and their types**
- **Return value and type**
- **Exceptions that might be thrown or passed back**
- **Information about the availability of the method in an object-oriented program** 

Function signatures are useful for:
- **Identifying data types**
  Understanding what data types a function's parameters expect and what type of output it produces 

- **Searching for library functions**
  When looking for a function in a library, you can narrow down the list of candidates by knowing the function's signature 

- **Removing boilerplate**
  In some programming languages, function signatures can help remove boilerplate code, making code smaller and more expressive

Another way to pseudo code before actually coding is writing function signatures. In fact, with C programs that’s often the case writing the function signatures in the header files before writing the implementation code in the other file.
