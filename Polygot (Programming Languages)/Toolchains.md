In the context of development, toolchains generally provide scaffolding, build systems, development servers, and packaging tools, making these three tools fit that description.

Reworded: A toolchain refers to a set of tools that work together to help developers streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

Example toolchains:
- **Expo**: Acts as a toolchain for React Native mobile development, providing tools, libraries, and a runtime for building, testing, and deploying apps across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web) without having to manage native code directly.
  
- **CRA (Create React App)**: Serves as a toolchain for React web development. It abstracts away the configuration of build tools like Webpack and Babel, letting developers focus on coding rather than setting up the environment.
  
- **Vite**: Is a fast, modern toolchain that provides a development server with hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds. It works across multiple frameworks, like React, Vue, and Svelte.
