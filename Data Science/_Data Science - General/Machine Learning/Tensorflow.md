Tensorflow:

Works well with jupyter-lab / jupyter notebooks, but you can also run them in python scripts.

Good for machine learning (Machine learning is a field of data scientists that deals with helping machines learn so they can have artificial intelligence). Has some memory management and also a lot of math involved. 

You can use it for voice recognition, sentiment analysis, language detection, text summarization, image recognition, video detection, time series, and more.

Requirements:
- python (is python language based)
- jupyter lab / jupyter notebook
- Or you can install the suite called Anaconda which includes these and more for data science https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html


You can add tensorflow to notebook by:
```
pip install â€“upgrade pip
pip install tensorflow
```

This will also be added to python so you can run:
```
python3 some-tensorflow-code.py
```

The code must have
```
import tensorflow
```
