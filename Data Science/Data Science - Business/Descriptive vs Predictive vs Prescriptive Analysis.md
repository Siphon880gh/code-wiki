Descriptive Analysis: This type of analysis focuses on summarizing and understanding historical data. It answers the question, "What has happened?" by looking at past events and data. For instance, a descriptive analysis might look at sales data from the previous year to determine how many units of a product were sold.

Predictive Analysis: Predictive analytics is about forecasting future events based on historical data. It uses various statistical, modeling, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data to make predictions about the future. For example, it might involve predicting future sales based on past sales trends, economic factors, and market research.

Prescriptive Analysis: This type of analysis goes one step further by recommending actions you can take to affect desired outcomes. Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen. Further, it suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. For example, if predictive analysis shows a likely decrease in sales, prescriptive analysis might suggest specific marketing strategies to counteract this predicted trend.

So, in summary:

Descriptive: What has happened?
Predictive: What could happen in the future?
Prescriptive: What should we do about it?
