## Why Docker - Vs VirtualBox etc

The key difference between normal virtual machines we run such as on VirtualBox is that in Docker not every container has to bring a complete operating system. For instance, you want to install and run Ubuntu 20.04 Server virtually but with a very minimalistic approach, I mean only core files that you need to run this server OS because, on Docker, the Containers are going to share the same kernel.
