### CentOS
- **Update Frequency**: CentOS has long times between updates, which makes it a stable and reliable option for enterprise environments where stability is crucial. But it is not ideal for cutting edge when you're implementing new tech all the time

### Ubuntu
- **Update Frequency**: Ubuntu offers frequent updates and regular releases, including LTS (Long-Term Support) versions which are supported for five years.

### Debian
- **Update Frequency**: Debian strikes a balance with a stable release cycle and occasional updates, making it reliable yet relatively up-to-date.
- **Proxmox Compatibility**: Are you on a dedicated server and need to make multiple VPS so you have control of restarting, restoring, and allocating CPU use? Debian is highly compatible with Proxmox.

Proxmox on Ubuntu? No!

Proxmox is meant to be on Debian server. You use a Debian 12 server install with Proxmox.
