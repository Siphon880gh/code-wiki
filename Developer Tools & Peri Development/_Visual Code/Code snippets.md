There are Global User Snippets and User Snippets that pop up in a dropdown as you type and lets you autocomplete. The type of suggestions depend on what you're typing and the file extension of the file you're editing (.json vs .js etc). A file's all available user snippets can be viewed on the sidepanel with CMD+SHIFT+P > ES: Open Snippet View.

Add your own User Snippets:
CMD+SHIFT+P -> Preference: Configure User Snippets -> File extension or format ->
```
    // Place your snippets for javascript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
    // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
    // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
    // same ids are connected.
    // Example:
    // "Print to console": {
    // 	"prefix": "log",
    // 	"body": [
    // 		"console.log('$1');",
    // 		"$2"
    // 	],
    // 	"description": "Log output to console"
    // }
```
