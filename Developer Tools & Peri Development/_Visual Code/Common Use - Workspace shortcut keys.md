## Splitting views

Useful for when you need to make edits to two files simultaneously, when you need to use one for reference (for example, need the DOM ID's and class names while you're creating the CSS rules in the stylesheet file), or you want to see different portions of the same file simultaneously (edits will sync across). That's only some of the uses.

Right click a file tab at the top -> Split..
