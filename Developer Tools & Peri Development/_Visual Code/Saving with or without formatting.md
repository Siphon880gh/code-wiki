You can search for formatters for JSON, JS, etc, and when you save your file, it'll automatically format it with tabs and spacing so that it looks conventional.

But this becomes problematic when you purposely don't want the usual formatting for a file because you need it indented a certain way to be readable. You can save without applying formatters by opening the command with CMD+SHIFT+P and searching for "Save without formatting". This would be instead of saving or running CMD+S.

You can setup a shortcut that does this with by running command with CMD+SHIFT+P and searching for "Preference: Open Keyboard Shortcuts". Then search for "Save without formatting". I recommend setting the shortcut to CMD+SHIFT+S and remove any existing bindings for that shortcut.
