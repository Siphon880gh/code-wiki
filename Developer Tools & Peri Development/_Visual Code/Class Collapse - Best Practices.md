For an easier workflow, the class "..." might get in the way when you're trying to edit a line of code and it expands and some other line collapses, and your clicking loses position

Here's how you have control when to turn on or off the collapse:
- CMD+Shift+P â†’ Class Collapse
- Set keybinding to CMD+OPT+C. Remove all other conflicts if prompted (copy active path, case searching... you can do that all manually)
