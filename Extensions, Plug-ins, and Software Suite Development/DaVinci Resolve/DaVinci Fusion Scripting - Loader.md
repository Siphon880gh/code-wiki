Loader lets you load in video clips, images, sounds, etc into the Fusion page. When you SHIFT+Space to add a Loader node, it automatically opens your File Browser to navigate to a file to load in. 

The power of having Loader is that your Fusion Scripting can have filepaths to assets that become part of the final Fusion effect. If you look at the Inspector side panel for the Loader node, you'll see that filename, and that is actually a filepath, is one of the properties, which means your Fusion scripting can have filename pointing to a filepath
