Procedural programming and imperative programming are related concepts in computer programming, but they are not exactly the same. Here's how they differ:

1. **Imperative Programming:** This is a programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state. It focuses on describing how a program operates. The programmer instructs the computer on what to do by telling it how to change its state. Imperative programming includes a variety of paradigms, including procedural programming and object-oriented programming.

2. **Procedural Programming:** This is a subset of imperative programming. Procedural programming is based on the concept of procedure calls, where procedures (also known as routines, subroutines, or functions) are a series of computational steps to be carried out. In procedural programming, a program is structured into procedures, which can be called upon to perform their defined tasks. While procedural programming emphasizes the use of procedures to operate on program data, it still falls under the broader umbrella of imperative programming because it involves specifying the steps the program must take to reach a desired state.

In summary, all procedural programming is imperative, but not all imperative programming is procedural. Imperative programming is the broader term, encompassing any style of programming where you explicitly state the commands that the computer must perform. Procedural programming is a specific way of achieving this, by organizing code into procedures or functions.
