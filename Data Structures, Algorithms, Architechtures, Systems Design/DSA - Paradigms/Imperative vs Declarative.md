We will also talk about control flow so there's a concept we can apply to imperative vs declarative

In computer science, control flow, also known as flow of control, refers to the sequence in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated within a program. This concept is fundamental in understanding how programs operate, as it determines the way a computer will process the instructions given to it.

### Imperative Programming:

- **Imperative Programming:** In imperative programming languages, the control flow is explicitly specified by the programmer. Here, you tell the computer "how" to do something by defining a sequence of instructions. The languages that fall under this paradigm, such as C, Java, and Python, require the programmer to outline a clear and precise series of operations for the computer to execute.
- **Control Flow Statements:** These are the constructs within imperative languages that allow for more dynamic and flexible program execution. They include conditionals (like `if`, `else if`, `else`), loops (like `for`, `while`, `do-while`), and jumps (`break`, `continue`, `return`), among others. These statements enable the program to make decisions, repeat operations, and alter the execution path based on certain conditions.

### Declarative Programming:

- **Declarative Programming:** Contrasting with imperative programming, declarative programming focuses on the "what" rather than the "how." In this paradigm, you describe what you want the outcome to be without explicitly detailing the control flow or the steps to achieve that outcome. SQL (for database queries) and HTML (for web page structure) are examples of declarative languages.
- **Less Emphasis on Control Flow:** In declarative languages, the emphasis on explicit control flow is reduced. For example, when you write a SQL query to fetch data from a database, you don't specify how to iterate over the records; you just define what conditions the data must meet.
