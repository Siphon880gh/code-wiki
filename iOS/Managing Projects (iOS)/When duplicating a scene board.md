Click a scene board by its title bar. Then CMD+C, CMD+V. Then it might look like it's not duplicated but you can look at the Document Outline to see a new scene was created. Then drag and drop the scene board elsewhere because it was on top of the older scene board. There will be an error that two view controllers have the same storyboard identifier. Go to the Identity Inspector and change the Storyboard ID to an appropriate name. Change the class name too after you create a VC swift file with the right class name.

OBSOLETE way: In Document Outline, select the scene board (entire scene board at root level of document outline). CMD+C
Click an empty area in the storyboard (can even be another storyboard), and CMD + V. You might have to drag it back into place on the storyboard visually
