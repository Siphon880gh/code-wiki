Xcode provides a plethora of keyboard shortcuts to streamline your development process. The shortcuts you mentioned are particularly useful for accessing documentation and adjusting the editor view. Here's a brief overview:

1. **CMD+SHIFT+0 (zero)**: This shortcut opens the Xcode documentation. It's extremely handy when you need quick access to the API reference, developer guides, sample code, or other documentation resources directly within Xcode.

2. **Zoom In/Out in the Editor**:
   - **CMD+SHIFT+Plus (+)**: This shortcut zooms in on the text in the editor, increasing its size. It's useful when you need to see code more clearly or when presenting your code to others.
   - **CMD+SHIFT+Minus (-)**: This shortcut zooms out on the text in the editor, decreasing its size. It allows you to see more code on the screen at once.

Here are a few more essential Xcode shortcuts that can enhance your productivity:

- **CMD+B**: Build the current scheme.
- **CMD+R**: Run the application in the selected simulator or device.
- **CMD+Y**: Start or stop debugging.
- **CMD+U**: Run the unit tests for the current scheme.
- **CMD+/ (forward slash)**: Comment or uncomment the current line or selected lines of code.
- **CMD+SHIFT+K**: Clean the build folder, which can sometimes resolve peculiar build issues.
- **CMD+[ and CMD+]**: Indent or outdent the selected line or block of code.
- **CMD+SHIFT+L**: Quickly insert a snippet of code from the snippets library.
- **CMD+OPTION+ENTER**: Open or close the Assistant Editor.
- **CMD+OPTION+LEFT/RIGHT ARROW**: Collapse or expand the code block.

These shortcuts can significantly speed up your workflow by reducing the reliance on mouse or trackpad interactions. Over time, integrating these shortcuts into your development routine will make your Xcode usage more efficient and streamlined.
