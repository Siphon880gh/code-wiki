Make the simulated screen bigger/wider in Storyboard:
You can turn on ability to resize the scenes in the canvas by making it Freeform instead of Fixed: Click first orange icon above the scene -> Inspector panel shows up on the right -> View Controller -> Size tab -> Stimulated Size -> Freeform -> Resize the actual scene in the canvas by dragging.
But then the insid view doesn't fill up the canvas, so next, in the Inspector panel -> Attributes tab -> Simulated Metrics -> Size: -> Secondary.
