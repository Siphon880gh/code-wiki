In iOS development, the distinction between "push" and "present" view controllers is crucial for managing navigation and the presentation of different screens within your application. Understanding when to use push or present is fundamental to creating intuitive and user-friendly navigation within your iOS apps.

1. **Push ViewController:**
    
    - Push is used with a navigation controller (`UINavigationController`).
    - When you push a view controller, it is added to the top of the navigation stack, and the navigation controller manages the transition.
    - The new view controller slides in from the right and the previous controller remains in the stack, allowing for a back navigation.
    - A back button is automatically provided to return to the previous screen.
    - This is typically used to navigate deeper into an application's hierarchy, maintaining a sense of where the user is within the app's structure.
    - Example usage: `navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)`
2. **Present ViewController:**
    
    - Presenting a view controller is not tied to a navigation controller.
    - When you present a view controller, it is displayed on top of the current context, often covering it entirely, but it can be configured in various presentation styles (e.g., full screen, over current context, popover, etc.).
    - The presented view controller does not belong to the navigation stack.
    - It's often used for modal interactions that require the user to complete a task or view important information before returning to the previous context.
    - When you present a view controller, you typically need to dismiss it to go back to the previous screen.
    - Example usage: `present(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)`

**Choosing between Push and Present:**

- Use **push** when you want to maintain a navigational context or history, allowing the user to navigate back to previous screens.
- Use **present** for modal interactions where you need to interrupt the current flow to capture the user's attention or require an action to be taken.
