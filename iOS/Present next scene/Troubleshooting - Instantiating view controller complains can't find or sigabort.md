When instantiating a view controller / rendering, it complains that it can't find a scene with that identifier or gives a vague SIGABORT error.


\> The view controller / scene requires that a storyboard ID and the module must be chosen (your project name). If it doesn't let you select your project name, then you may need to tick 'Inherit Module from Target'.
