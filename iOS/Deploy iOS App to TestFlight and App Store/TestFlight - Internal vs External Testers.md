Internal testers are usually members of your organization who are registered in your App Store Connect team. These can include developers, designers, and other employees. **Limit:** You can add up to 25 internal testers per app. Builds available to internal testers do not require approval from Apple before they can be tested. Internal testing is ideal for early-stage, more frequent builds where immediate feedback and rapid iteration are required.

External testers are people outside your organization. They could be actual customers, clients, or users who are interested in testing early versions of your app. You can invite up to 10,000 external testers per app through their email addresses. Unlike internal testers, builds meant for external testers require a review and approval by Apple. This ensures that even your beta version complies with the basic guidelines of app submissions. External testing is suited for later-stage builds where the app is more stable; It's an opportunity to gather feedback on user experience, features, and performance from a wider, more diverse audience.
