Apple reviews your app before they can be published from TestFlight to the App Store. They are very strict. This is not an exhaustive list.
## Feature Based
For example, if your app has profile features (like in social media), Apple requirements include:
- Account deletion
- Blocking users
- Explaining why people upload a profile picture


## Region Based
Laws could change. Can deploy to Europe, you need to provide the ability to delete all your data if any data is tracked.

## General
EULA agreement screen
Screenshots meeting requirements (Include a screenshot of using the app)

## Crashing
It might not crash on your devices but Apple can detect it crashing on their whole library of iPhones, iPads, etc. Refer to [[Online iOS testing services with remote devices]]
