When crafting your app's description for App Store Connect, adhering to specific guidelines can increase your chances of approval. Apple does refuse apps based on poorly written app descriptions (too vague, etc). Here are some general guidelines to follow:

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Your description should be clear and concise, offering a straightforward explanation of what your app does. Avoid jargon or overly technical language that might confuse potential users.
    
2. **Specificity**: Be specific about what your app offers and how it benefits users. Avoid vague statements that don't convey the unique value of your app. Clearly articulate the features and functionalities that set your app apart from others.
    
3. **User-Centric**: Focus on the user's experience and the benefits they will gain from using your app. Explain how the app will solve a problem, enhance their daily life, or provide a unique form of entertainment or utility.
    
4. **Value Proposition**: Highlight the key value proposition of your app. What makes it a must-have? Why should users download it? Be persuasive but not overly promotional.
    
5. **Feature Highlights**: Clearly list the key features and functionalities of your app. Use bullet points or a concise paragraph to showcase these features in a way that is easy to read and understand.
    
6. **Avoid Promotional Language**: While it's important to market your app, avoid overly promotional language that could be perceived as spammy or misleading. Stick to factual and straightforward descriptions.
    
7. **Compliance with Guidelines**: Ensure your description complies with Apple's App Store Review Guidelines. Avoid any content that could be interpreted as objectionable or in violation of these guidelines.
    
8. **Updates and Accuracy**: Keep your app's description updated with any new features or changes. An outdated description can lead to user confusion and dissatisfaction.
    
9. **Localization**: If your app is available in multiple languages, provide localized descriptions to cater to your global audience effectively.
    
10. **Keywords**: While not part of the description visible to users, carefully choose keywords related to your app. These should be relevant to the app's functionality and the terms users might use to find an app like yours.
    

By following these guidelines, you can craft a compelling and clear description for your app, increasing its chances of approval on App Store Connect and helping potential users understand why they should download your app.
