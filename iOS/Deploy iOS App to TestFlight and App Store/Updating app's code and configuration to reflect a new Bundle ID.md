Updating your app's code and configurations to reflect a new bundle ID involves several key steps, particularly if your app integrates with external services or relies on specific configurations tied to the bundle ID. Here's a detailed breakdown of what you should consider and update:

1. **Update Project Settings in Xcode**:
    
    - Open your project in Xcode.
    - Select your app target, then go to the "General" tab.
    - Change the "Bundle Identifier" to your new bundle ID.
    - Ensure that this change is reflected in all relevant targets, including any app extensions or watchOS apps.
2. **Update App Capabilities**:
    
    - If your app uses capabilities like push notifications, Wallet, or iCloud, you need to reconfigure these in the Apple Developer portal and Xcode.
    - For each capability, ensure that the new bundle ID has the appropriate services enabled and configured.
3. **Provisioning Profiles and Certificates**:
    
    - You will need to generate new provisioning profiles that match the new bundle ID.
    - Download and install these new profiles in Xcode to ensure your app can be signed and deployed.
4. **Third-Party Services and SDKs**:
    
    - Update the bundle ID in any third-party service dashboards (e.g., Firebase, analytics platforms, crash reporting tools).
    - If these services use SDKs that require initialization with the bundle ID, update the initialization code in your app.
5. **URL Schemes**:
    
    - If your app uses custom URL schemes, ensure they are updated if they include the bundle ID.
    - Update any external links or deep links that use these URL schemes.
6. **App Groups and Keychain Sharing**:
    
    - If you're using app groups or keychain sharing, update the group identifier to reflect the new bundle ID, as these often include the bundle ID as part of the identifier.
7. **Configuration Files**:
    
    - If your app relies on configuration files that include the bundle ID (like a GoogleService-Info.plist for Firebase), update these files or obtain new ones that match the new bundle ID.
8. **Code References**:
    
    - Search your codebase for any hardcoded references to the old bundle ID and update them. This might be relevant for custom logic that relies on the bundle ID.
9. **Testing**:
    
    - After making these changes, thoroughly test your app to ensure that all functionalities work as expected with the new bundle ID.
    - Pay special attention to features that rely on app-specific configurations, like push notifications or shared data.

By carefully updating these aspects of your app's code and configurations, you can ensure a smooth transition to the new bundle ID, maintaining the functionality and integrity of your app.
