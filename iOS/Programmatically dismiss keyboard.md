```
self.view.endEditing(true)
```


The line `self.view.endEditing(true)` is a Swift command commonly used in iOS app development to dismiss the keyboard.

When you're creating an app, there might be instances where the keyboard is displayed because the user is expected to input text into a text field or text view. However, once the user is done, you'll want to provide a way to dismiss the keyboard, making the user interface more friendly and preventing the keyboard from obscuring content.

Here's how `self.view.endEditing(true)` works:

- `self` refers to the current view controller instance.
- `view` is a property of the view controller, representing the main view that the controller manages.
- `endEditing(_:)` is a method that you call on the view. When you pass `true` to this method, it tells the view to resign its first-responder status, effectively causing the keyboard to be dismissed.

The first-responder in iOS is the UI element that is currently receiving input events. When a text field or text view becomes the first responder, the keyboard is presented. By calling `endEditing(true)`, you're asking the view to traverse its subviews and tell the current first responder (the text input control) to resign, thus hiding the keyboard.
