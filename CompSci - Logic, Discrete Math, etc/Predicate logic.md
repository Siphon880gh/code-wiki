Predicate logic, often referred to as first-order logic, extends propositional logic by introducing more complexity and expressive power through the use of domains, quantifiers, and predicates. This allows for much richer expressions about properties of objects and relationships between them. Here are the key elements that differentiate predicate logic from propositional logic:

1. **Domains**: In predicate logic, there's typically a domain or universe of discourse, which is the set of all things being discussed. Each element in the domain can be a subject of predicates.

2. **Quantifiers**: Predicate logic uses quantifiers to specify the quantity of subjects to which the predicate applies. The two most common quantifiers are:
   - **Universal Quantifier ("forall")**: This quantifier is used to state that a predicate holds for all elements of the domain. For example, "forall x P(x)" means "For every x, P(x) is true."
   - **Existential Quantifier ("exists")**: This quantifier states that there is at least one element in the domain for which the predicate holds true. For example, "exists x P(x)" means "There exists an x such that P(x) is true."
   - **Singularly**: About specific individuals
	   - Kermit is a FROG = Fk
	   - Note the k is a subscript

3. **Predicates**: Unlike propositional logic, where the basic units are propositions that are simply true or false, predicate logic uses predicates that can be applied to variables or constants from the domain to make statements. For example, if D(x) represents "x is a dog," and x ranges over animals, then D(Fido) asserts that Fido is a dog.

4. **Variables and Constants**: Predicate logic allows for variables, which can stand in for any element of the domain, and constants, which refer to specific elements in the domain.

5. **Logical Connectives**: Predicate logic also includes the logical connectives found in propositional logic (such as and, or, not, if-then) to build more complex statements.

Predicate logic's ability to handle these elements makes it particularly useful for formalizing mathematical proofs, defining algorithms in computer science, and modeling complex systems in artificial intelligence. This logic captures not just whether statements are true or false, but how those truths are conditioned by the properties of and relations between different entities.

You'll see symbols in place:
- forall is the character ∀
- exists is the character ∃
- logical connections 
	- and ^
	- or v
	- not ¬
	- implies →

What it is: Like propositional logic, you are writing a statement that needs to be proven. While propositional logic can easily be proven with a truth table, predicate logic cannot always be distilled to a single truth table to be proven. You have to follow other methods:

- **Deductive Systems**: Predicate logic often uses formal systems of deduction, such as natural deduction or sequent calculi, which provide rules for deriving conclusions from premises.
    
- **Semantic Arguments**: These involve discussing the meanings of the predicates and the structure of the domain to demonstrate the truth of a statement.
    
- **Model Theory**: This branch of mathematical logic involves studying the interpretations (models) of theories in predicate logic. Proofs may involve showing that a statement is true in all models (valid) or finding a specific model where the statement holds (satisfiable).


Below this note will be a simple predicate problem that CAN be solved with truth table.

What is is NOT: Predicate statement to communicate to a team member about rules, such as all of Q will be R.

Example Breakdown

Consider the statement:

- ∀x(P(x)→Q(x))

Where:

- P(x): "x is a bird."
- Q(x): "x can fly."

The truthfulness of this statement is evaluated as follows:

1. **Domain Definition**: First, the domain over which the variables range must be defined. In this case, **the domain might be all animals.**
    
2. **Predicate Interpretation**: The predicates P and Q need specific interpretations:
    
    - P(x) is true if x is a bird.
    - Q(x) is true if x can fly.
      
3. **Variable Assignment**: Evaluate the statement for each element x in the domain.
    
    - For each x in the domain, the implication P(x)→Q(x) must be checked.
    - P(x)→Q(x) follows the same truth table as the propositional implication. It's true unless P(x) is true and  Q(x) is false.
4. **Quantifier Handling**: Since the statement uses a universal quantifier (∀), the overall statement is true only if P(x)→Q(x) is true for every x in the domain. If there exists even one x for which P(x) is true and Q(x) is false, the entire statement is false.

Therefore here we used a truth table like we would do in prepositional logic problems. Not all predicate problems can be solved so simply
