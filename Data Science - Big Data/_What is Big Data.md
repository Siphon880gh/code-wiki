"Big data refers to extremely large and diverse collections of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data that continues to grow exponentially over time. These datasets are so huge and complex in volume, velocity, and variety, that traditional data management systems cannot store, process, and analyze them."

Cloud servers have the processing power and storage to host large datasets, so you'll find big data to be queried at Azure/Amazon/Google Cloud. Their motivation? Some businesses/apps need information from very large datasets. There is a BigQuery API from Google Cloud with paid plan. Azure and Amazon have their own too.
