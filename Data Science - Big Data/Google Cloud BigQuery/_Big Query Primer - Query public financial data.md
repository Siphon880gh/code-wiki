This guide will expose you to Big Query datasets that are on / via Google Cloud using their Big Query explorer, where the means of querying is either clicking through their datasets or running MySQL queries (which they will auto generate). Big Queries are massive sources of data such as IRS data and 10k from SEC.


1. Go on Google Cloud Platform's console.
	1. Create an App if you haven't yet. 
	   In this example, the app is Financial Query. Notice the url is at console

2. Go to Quick access -> APIs & Services -> Enable APIs and Services
3. OBJECTIVE: Browse to Big Query API reference for now:
	1. Search for: Big Query
	2. Open "Big Query API" -> Try this API
4. OBJECTIVE: Instead of following their API reference or coding from their API reference, launch their more intuitive Big Query Explorer
	1. Click "What is Big Query?"
	2. Under "Get started with BigQuery", click "BigQuery's sandbox"
	3. Click "Go to BigQuery" button
	4. You should've arrived to similar URL:
	   https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?_ga=2.32523774.1969827007.1698390845-1082998572.1695963768&_gac=1.20638282.1696545924.CjwKCAjwvfmoBhAwEiwAG2tqzO1NP6xMW3_7dMQzLXn_3dpOWJBK5-1dMBgGcD6CX0nRIMkq_nF-XxoCU2kQAvD_BwE&project=financial-query
5. OBJECTIVE: Start exploring public financial datasets
	1. Click +Add button either from Explorer sidepanel or the welcome panel.
	2. Under "Additional sources", click "Public Datasets"
	3. Search for: financial
6. OBJECTIVE: Expand to MySQL queries you can fine tune or display in intuitive Google Sheet
	1. Click SEC Public Dataset -> View Dataset
	2. On the left make sure to search the same name (Explorer sidepanel is glitchy and this can persist the relevant dataset)

	3. Click for the table "quick_summary". Click "Query" top tab to auto-generate and run MySQL query on table.
	4. Fine tune the MySQL to a smaller record set and to show all columns. Notice I am adding asterisk \* and changing their autogenerated limit of 1000 down to 100, and removing WHERE clause
			Original query: 

```
SELECT FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.quick_summary` WHERE TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(_PARTITIONTIME, DAY) = TIMESTAMP("2023-10-27") LIMIT 1000
```
			


				Modified query:
```
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.quick_summary` LIMIT 100
```


5. Click RUN

6. Now we've made the MySQL query useful. Now we change to other useful views
	1. Notice there's "Chart" secondary panel tab, but is not useful for this dataset. May be useful for other datasets
	2. There's a Google Sheet option. Click "EXPLORE DATA" drawer link: Explore Data -> Explore with Sheets

Exercise / Challenge: 
List the 10-K from SEC's quarterly financials. Hint: Is in submission table, where there's a form that's 10-K

Solution:
```
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.sec_quarterly_financials.submission` WHERE form="10-K" LIMIT 100
```
