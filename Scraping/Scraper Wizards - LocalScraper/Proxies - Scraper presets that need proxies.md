LocalScraper uses your computing resource and internet to perform the scraping and reporting. Certain sources are more likely to ban your IP if they detect ANY possible scraping by the volume of requests from your IP address.

See which source requires proxies at their Readme section “The Scrape Targets”
[https://www.localscraper.com/readme.php](https://www.localscraper.com/readme.php)  

For your convenience, I copied the table of proxy requirements here.

As of 1/2025, those that dont require proxies are: 
Google Map and Google Places, Email Finder, Bing Maps Quick (However Bing Maps Full DOES require proxies), and Yellow AU/DE (Australia, Germany)

\*For Home Advisor, proxies may only be needed in certain regions or at higher scraping volumes.
