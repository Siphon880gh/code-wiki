1. Fill a text file of domains like:
   sites.txt:
```
https://domain1.com
https://sub.domain1.com
https://domain2.com
```
   
   Blank lines in the middle are acceptable, will just be skipped.
2. At Custom URL List, load in the text file
3. Then click "Start Scraper"
4. Itâ€™ll give you the email and social links. Websites that can't be reached will simply be skipped (row wont appear in the final result)
