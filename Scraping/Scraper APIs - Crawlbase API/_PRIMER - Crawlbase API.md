- Note that proxy and ip rotation is already included in their Crawling API and Crawler products, as in when you use their product to scrape, you dont have to worry about an IP being blocked. The Smart Proxy is a separate product that lets you use their proxy for whatever reason (may not necessarily be for scraping).
- For Crawler API vs Crawler, refer to [[Crawlbase API vs Crawlbase Crawler]]

Token types
- Use the JavaScript token when the content you need to crawl is generated via JavaScript, either because it's a JavaScript built page (React, Angular, etc.) or because the content is dynamically generated on the browser.
- Otherwise use the Normal request token which is more performant.
