**Criteria's (Depending on your use case and budget):**

Free/Paid/Rates:
- How much free - times one credit or free credits every month (and do those credits roll over)?
- Is there a limit per second, per hour, per day, etc?

Wizard vs Custom Coding
- How much custom coded needed? Or is there a good ui I can use?
- Do they make the coding easier with API calls or their own libraries?

Not being blocked:
- Does it have proxy/ip rotation? Or do I have to connect my own paid proxy service

Scheduling:
- Can it be scheduled to run? Can it scale up and whats the payment arrangement for that if applicable? Can it multi-thread for faster performance?

Results
- Is it synchronously you have to wait for the response after the api call? Is it async? 
- Can it format to json or csv? Is it a html dump then I need to clean and restructure the data?

**Wizard / Visual Scraping Tools**

- Tools like **ParseHub**, **Octoparse**, and **WebScraper.io** often provide a point-and-click interface to select the data on a page, define pagination, etc.

**Custom Coding / APIs & Libraries**
- Libraries or frameworks like **Scrapy (Python)**, **Playwright**, **Puppeteer (Node.js)**, or **Beautiful Soup** allow more control but require more coding knowledge.
- Paid services like **Apify** and **Zyte** (formerly Scrapinghub) often provide both a platform (with a UI) and an API/SDK, giving you the best of both worlds.
