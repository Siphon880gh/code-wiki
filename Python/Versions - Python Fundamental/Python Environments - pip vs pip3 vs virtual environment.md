If you have pip installed (which is the Python package installer), you can install the `requests` library by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install requests
```

or if you're using Python 3 (which is highly recommended as Python 2 is no longer supported), you might need to use:

```bash
pip3 install requests
```

If you're using a Python virtual environment (which is also recommended), you should activate your virtual environment first before running the `pip install` command.
