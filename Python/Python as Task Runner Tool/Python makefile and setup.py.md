Makefile is a utility available in many OS including Linux, MacOS< BSD Variants, Unix-like systems, Windows...

While `Makefile` and `make` are still widely used, especially in older and large-scale projects, there are numerous other build systems and automation tools now available that are more tailored to specific programming languages or project needs, like `CMake` for C/C++, `Maven` or `Gradle` for Java, and task runners like `Gulp` or `Webpack` in the web development ecosystem.

We will use Makefile here as a task runner tool along with setup.py

Python has an equivalent to npm scripts for managing and running custom scripts: You combine Makefile with `setup.py` scripts.

1. **Makefile**: A `Makefile` is traditionally used with C/C++ development to automate the build process, but it can be used for Python or virtually any kind of scriptable task. You define tasks (like "start", "dev", etc.) and the commands they should run. Here's how you might translate your npm scripts into a Makefile:

```makefile
start:
cp runtime/template-prod.py runtime/env.py
echo 'var finalHost = "https://mydomain.com:5001"' > assets/common.js
echo 'If testing locally, can run `make dev`'
python server.py

dev:
cp runtime/template-dev.py runtime/env.py
echo 'var finalHost = "http://127.0.0.1:5001"; var guestPassword = "qwerty123";' > assets/common.js
python server.py

seed:
python seed.py

test:
python tests/docker.py
```

You can run these commands with `make start`, `make dev`, etc., similar to how you'd use npm scripts.

2. **setup.py**: If you're creating a distributable Python package, `setup.py` is used not only to package your code but to define custom commands as well. This might be more complex than you need, but it's powerful for larger Python projects.

To run commands from a `Makefile` in the command line, you'll need to have `make` installed on your system. It's usually available by default on Linux and macOS. For Windows, you might need to install it through a package manager like Chocolatey, or use a Linux-like environment such as WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

Here's how you would use it:

1. **Create a Makefile**: In your project directory, create a file named `Makefile` with no file extension. Inside it, you define your tasks (or "targets") and the commands they should execute, like the example I provided in the previous message.

2. **Running a Command**: Open your command line or terminal. Navigate to your project directory where the `Makefile` is located.

3. **Execute a Make Target**: Use the `make` command followed by the name of the target you want to run. For example, if you have a target named `start` in your `Makefile`, you would run:

    ```bash
    make start
    ```

This command tells `make` to execute the `start` target, which will run the series of commands you've defined under that target in the `Makefile`.

Here's a breakdown of what this might look like with your example:

- **To start your application in production mode**:
    ```bash
    make start
    ```
  This would execute the commands to set up your environment for production and then start your server.

- **To start your application in development mode**:
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```
  This would set up your environment for development and start the server.

- **To seed your database**:
    ```bash
    make seed
    ```

- **To run your tests**:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

Each of these commands corresponds to a target in your `Makefile` and will execute the series of commands you've associated with that target. If you encounter any errors about `make` not being recognized, it means you need to install it or access it through a compatible environment.

In Python projects, differentiating between a production setup and a local development setup often involves more than just a `setup.py` file. While `setup.py` is mainly for packaging and distribution, managing different environments (like production and development) typically involves a combination of environment variables, configuration files, and separate requirements files. Here's how you might handle different setups:

### 1. Environment Variables:
Use environment variables to change the behavior of your application depending on the environment. For example:

- **In Development**: Set an environment variable like `export APP_ENV=development`.
- **In Production**: Set `export APP_ENV=production`.

In your code, you would check this variable:

```python
import os

if os.getenv('APP_ENV') == 'production':
    # Production settings
else:
    # Development settings
```

### 2. Separate Requirements Files:
Have a different requirements file for production and development.

- **requirements.txt**: Basic requirements for running the application.
- **requirements-dev.txt**: Additional requirements for development (like linters, debuggers, etc.).

You can install development requirements with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 3. Configuration Files:
Use different configuration files for different environments.

- **config/development.py**: Development settings (like a debug mode, detailed error reports, etc.).
- **config/production.py**: Production settings (optimized, secure configurations).

Load the appropriate configuration based on the environment variable:

```python
if os.getenv('APP_ENV') == 'production':
    config = 'config.production'
else:
    config = 'config.development'
```

### 4. Using `setup.py` for Different Setups:
While `setup.py` isn't typically used to differentiate between production and development environments, you can technically use custom commands in `setup.py` to execute tasks relevant to each.

```python
from setuptools import setup, Command

class ProductionInstall(Command):
    description = 'Install dependencies for production'
    user_options = []

    def initialize_options(self):
        pass

    def finalize_options(self):
        pass

    def run(self):
        # commands to setup production environment
        print("Setting up for production...")

class DevelopmentInstall(Command):
    description = 'Install dependencies for development'
    user_options = []

    def initialize_options(self):
        pass

    def finalize_options(self):
        pass

    def run(self):
        # commands to setup development environment
        print("Setting up for development...")

setup(
    # ... other setup parameters ...
    cmdclass={
        'prod_install': ProductionInstall,
        'dev_install': DevelopmentInstall,
    },
)
```

To use these commands:

- **For Production**: `python setup.py prod_install`
- **For Development**: `python setup.py dev_install`

### Final Thoughts:
Managing different environments usually involves a mix of strategies tailored to the specific needs of your project. Tools like Docker can also be extremely helpful in creating consistent development and production environments. Frameworks like Flask and Django have their own ways of managing settings for different environments, so it's worth checking their documentation as well.

### Other approaches

There are other approaches to automate developer workflows in regards to typing up commands to build, test, deploy, migrate, etc

  
1. **Python scripts**: For simpler needs, you might just write separate Python scripts or bash scripts and run them directly, e.g., `python start.py`.  
  
2. **Pipenv Scripts**: If you're using Pipenv, which is a packaging tool for Python, it allows you to define custom scripts in the `Pipfile`. This can be a direct analog to npm scripts.  
  
3. **Invoke**: This is a Python task execution tool that lets you define tasks in a `tasks.py` file. It's somewhat similar to `Makefile` but written in Python.  
  
6. **Poetry**: Another modern packaging and dependency management tool for Python that allows you to define custom scripts in its `pyproject.toml` file.  
  
Each of these has its own benefits and might suit different aspects of your development workflow. For straightforward translations of npm scripts and general usage, a `Makefile` is often the simplest and most direct approach.
