Vector search gives us the ability to semantically query the billions of real-time signals we receive as part of our checkout experience that flow back to Astra DB. We plan to use Google Cloud’s Generative AI capabilities alongside Astra DB’s vector search to power our real time data infrastructure and Generative AI experiences.
