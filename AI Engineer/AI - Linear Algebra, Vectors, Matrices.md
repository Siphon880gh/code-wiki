Linear Algebra, its Vectors and Matrices, and its applications to various fields including AI  

Vector are arrows on a graph, whether 2d or 3d (xyz)
Matrixes are representations of those vectors in math form that can be carried

Background
- Row x column matrix
- In compsci each row is a different metric unit
- In physics each row is a different dimension in 3d space
- Therefore the rows are more important and is said first in 3x1 matrix, 2x1 matrix etc

Physics:
Gives a language to describe space and calculate it

Comp Sci:
Arrays or multidimensional arrays of house pricing vs interest rate that you can run scripts to calculate statistics etc on

Btw, if you have A and B as the sides, you can calculate hypotenuse, which is the length of the arrow. A square + B square, and squared rooted.

Two words great good can be assigned numeric values. The numeric values will be similar if they have similar meanings. But good and great can be used in different contexts (that deal was a great!) (oh... that was great... - sarcasm). gs. I am guessing so you will have a list of numeric values per word. But you want similarity to be expressed between pairs of numbers between the two words that are at different points in their lists, so that’s why you use matrix (similarity by location in the matrix too)

Actual ChatGPT:

Your understanding of how words like "great" and "good" can be assigned numeric values and their contextual usage is quite insightful. In natural language processing, this concept is often handled through techniques such as word embeddings and context-aware models.

1. **Word Embeddings**: Words are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors are not just arbitrary; they are trained so that words with similar meanings are closer in this space. This is how numeric values are assigned to words. Words like "good" and "great" would have vectors that are relatively close in this space, reflecting their similar meanings.
    
2. **Contextual Nuance**: Traditional word embeddings, like Word2Vec or GloVe, don't handle context very well. They assign the same vector to a word, regardless of its use. To address this, context-aware models like BERT or GPT (like the one you're interacting with now) were developed. These models generate word vectors that are sensitive to the surrounding words, thus capturing nuances like sarcasm or specific phrases ("that deal was a great one!").
    
3. **Matrix Representation**: When you mentioned the use of matrices, it seems like you're referring to how these vectors are used in computations. In many natural language processing tasks, matrices are indeed used. For example, a sentence might be represented as a matrix where each row is the vector of a word in the sentence. The similarity between words or sentences can be computed using operations on these matrices.
    
4. **Contextual Similarity**: In the examples you provided ("that was great" with sarcasm vs. "that deal was great"), a context-aware model would understand the difference based on surrounding words and intonation implied in text. This is achieved through complex mechanisms within the model that pay attention to the order and combination of words.

In summary, words are assigned numeric vectors, and the similarity in meaning is reflected in the closeness of these vectors in a multi-dimensional space. Context-aware models add another layer by adjusting these vectors based on the surrounding words, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of language.
