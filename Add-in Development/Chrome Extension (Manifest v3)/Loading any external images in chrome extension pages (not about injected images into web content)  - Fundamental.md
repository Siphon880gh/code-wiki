To enable loading any URL for `img-src` in Chrome extension development, you need to modify the Content Security Policy (CSP) in the extension's manifest file. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Open the `manifest.json` file** of your Chrome extension.

2. **Locate the `content_security_policy` key**. If it doesn't exist, you'll need to add it.

3. **Modify or add the `img-src` directive** to allow any URL. To do this, set its value to `'img-src * data:'`.

Here's an example of what the `content_security_policy` might look like:

```json
{
...
"content_security_policy": "script-src 'self' https://example.com; object-src 'self'; img-src * data:",
...
}
```


In this example:

- `script-src 'self' https://example.com;` allows scripts to be loaded from the extension itself and `https://example.com`.
- `object-src 'self';` allows objects (like `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements) to only load resources from the extension itself.
- `img-src * data:;` allows images to be loaded from any source and also allows inline images using the `data:` URI scheme.

**Important Notes**:

- Modifying the CSP to allow any URL can introduce security risks. Only do this if you're sure about the sources from which you're loading content.

- Always follow the principle of least privilege. Only allow what you need and nothing more.

- If you're loading content from specific trusted domains, it's better to list those domains explicitly rather than using a wildcard `*`.

- After making changes to the `manifest.json` file, make sure to reload your extension in the Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`) for the changes to take effect.
