A stack would be an excellent choice for implementing an undo feature in JavaScript where you don't need to handle redo functionality. A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, which aligns perfectly with the behavior expected from an undo mechanism.

Here's a brief overview of how you could implement it:

1. **Push Operations to the Stack**: Every time a user performs an action that should be undoable (like typing text, moving an item, etc.), you push the state or the action to the stack.

2. **Pop for Undo**: When the user wants to undo the last action, you pop the top item from the stack. This item represents the most recent action and can either be the previous state to revert to or an inverse action to perform.

3. **Clear the Stack on New Actions**: If the user starts a new action after having undone previous actions, it's a common practice to clear the stack (or a portion of it), as redo isn't needed. This avoids any inconsistent states.

Here is a simple example in JavaScript to demonstrate the concept:

```javascript
class UndoStack {
    constructor() {
        this.stack = [];
    }

    addAction(action) {
        this.stack.push(action);
    }

    undo() {
        if (this.stack.length > 0) {
            const lastAction = this.stack.pop();
            // Depending on what `action` includes, reverse it
            return lastAction;
        } else {
            console.log("No actions to undo.");
        }
    }

    clear() {
        this.stack = [];
    }
}

// Example Usage
const undoManager = new UndoStack();
undoManager.addAction("write A");
undoManager.addAction("write B");
console.log(undoManager.undo()); // Should reverse "write B"
```

In this example, `addAction` would store an action or state change, `undo` would remove the most recent action from the stack and reverse it, and `clear` would empty the stack when starting a new sequence of actions.
