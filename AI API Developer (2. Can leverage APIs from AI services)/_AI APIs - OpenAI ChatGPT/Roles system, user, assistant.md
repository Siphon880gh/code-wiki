TLDR:
- The **system message** sets the assistant's expertise (geography).
- The **user messages** provide input (e.g., questions).
- The **assistant messages** reflect previous responses, allowing the model to maintain context.
  
In the **Chat Completions API**, the roles `system`, `user`, and `assistant` are key components of the `messages` array. These roles help structure the interaction and provide context to the model for generating appropriate responses. Here's how each role is used:

---

### **1. `system` Role**

- **Purpose**: Sets the behavior, personality, or rules for the assistant.
- **When to Use**: At the beginning of a conversation to establish context or define constraints.
- **Example**:
    ```
    {  
      "role": "system",  
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant that provides concise answers and avoids technical jargon."  
    }  
	```
    
- **Effect**:
	- Guides how the assistant responds throughout the conversation.
	- You can adjust tone, style, and the assistant's expertise (e.g., making it friendly, professional, or humorous).

---

### **2. `user` Role**

- **Purpose**: Represents the input or queries from the end user interacting with the assistant.
- **When to Use**: For every message or question sent to the assistant.
- **Example**:
    ```
    {  
      "role": "user",  
      "content": "What is the capital of France?"  
    }  
	```

- **Effect**:
	- Directly informs the assistant what to respond to.
	- Multiple `user` entries in the `messages` array create a conversational context.

### **3. `assistant` Role**

- **Purpose**: Represents the assistant’s responses in the conversation.
- **When to Use**: For replies generated by the assistant.
- **Example**:
    ```
    {  
      "role": "assistant",  
      "content": "The capital of France is Paris."  
    }  
	```

- **Effect**:
	- Helps maintain context by showing the model what it has previously "said."
	- Crucial for multi-turn conversations to ensure continuity.
