## üìå **Yarn vs NPM: A Comparison**

Yarn and NPM are the two most popular package managers for JavaScript projects, and they are in a **tight race** when it comes to **features, speed, and dependency management**. At one point, **Yarn was ahead** of NPM in terms of performance and features, but NPM has since caught up.

### üîπ **Similarities Between Yarn & NPM**

- **Both use `package.json`** for project dependencies.
- **Both have a lock file**:
    - `package-lock.json` (NPM)
    - `yarn.lock` (Yarn)
- **Both can run scripts** defined in `package.json`:
    - `npm run SCRIPT`
    - `yarn run SCRIPT`
- **Both allow global installations** (`-g` for NPM, `global` for Yarn).
- **Both support workspaces for monorepos**.

## ‚ö° **Key Differences Between Yarn & NPM**

|Feature|Yarn|NPM|
|---|---|---|
|**Installation Command**|`yarn add <package>`|`npm install <package>`|
|**Version Lock File**|`yarn.lock`|`package-lock.json`|
|**Install Dependencies**|`yarn install`|`npm install`|
|**Install a Specific Version**|`yarn add package@1.2.3`|`npm install package@1.2.3`|
|**Remove a Package**|`yarn remove <package>`|`npm uninstall <package>`|
|**Global Package Install**|`yarn global add <package>`|`npm install -g <package>`|
|**Cache Efficiency**|Uses a local offline cache|Redownloads on each install (though improved with `npm ci`)|
|**Speed**|Generally faster due to parallel installation|Slower than Yarn but improved in NPM v7+|
|**Workspaces**|Built-in support|Added in NPM v7+|
|**Security Checks**|`yarn audit`|`npm audit`|

## üõ†Ô∏è **Choosing Between Yarn & NPM**

### ‚úÖ **Use Yarn if:**

- You want **faster** and **more reliable** installs.
- You prefer **automatic offline caching** (installs from cache instead of downloading again).
- You're working in a **monorepo** (Yarn workspaces are very useful).

### ‚úÖ **Use NPM if:**

- You want **default support with Node.js** (no need to install Yarn separately).
- You're using **newer versions of NPM (v7+)**, which have improved speed and workspace support.
- You prefer **better integration with the JavaScript ecosystem** (NPM is the default for most projects).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do Not Use Both NPM and Yarn in the Same Project**

Mixing **NPM** and **Yarn** in the same project **can cause dependency conflicts, unexpected behavior, and inconsistencies** in package management.

### ‚ùå **Why You Shouldn't Use Both NPM & Yarn**

1. **Conflicting Lock Files**
    
    - **NPM** uses `package-lock.json`
    - **Yarn** uses `yarn.lock`  
        If both exist, it can confuse dependency resolution, causing different package versions in different environments.
2. **Inconsistent Dependency Resolution**
    
    - Yarn and NPM **resolve versions differently**.
    - If you switch between them, you may get **different package versions**, leading to unexpected bugs.
3. **Duplicate `node_modules` Issues**
    
    - Some dependencies may be **installed differently** by Yarn vs NPM, causing conflicts inside `node_modules`.
    - This may break your project or cause subtle errors.
4. **Confusion for Team Members & CI/CD**
    
    - If some developers use **NPM** and others use **Yarn**, package versions may differ, leading to **"works on my machine"** issues.
    - CI/CD pipelines may also fail due to lockfile conflicts.
