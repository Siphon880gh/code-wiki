Say you want to implement a feature into your app

1. Get an optimized prompt to create an app that would have the feature you want. Optimize the prompt using ChatGPT, then generating the code using Websim:
	- Refer to major steps/sections I, II, and III at [[__GENERATE FULL LAYOUTS with WebSim & ChatGPT]]. No need to go beyond those steps.
2. Copy relevant code of the desired feature. You may have to copy multiple sections (css, html, javascript).
3. In Cursor AI, open the page where the feature would be visible to the user, and open Chat with CMD+L. Paste the snippet(s) in there and prompt Cursor AI to:
```
Implement {Describe feature}. I believe the code resembles {Paste code snippets}.
```
