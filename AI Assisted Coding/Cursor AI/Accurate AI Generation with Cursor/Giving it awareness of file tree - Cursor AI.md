**How to**

You can feed the file tree to the chat:
`tree -L 2 | pbcopy`  to copy the tree level to clipboard so you can paste. 

Then CMD+V paste into the chat.

```
brew install tree
```

**Mnemonic pbcopy**

The **"pb"** in `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` stands for **"pasteboard"**, which is another term for the clipboard on macOS.
