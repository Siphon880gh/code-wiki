- Cursor AI: Aims to be accurate and relevant in the project.
- GitHub Copilot: Uses data from GitHubâ€™s large code library. Helps you explore new libraries and functions.

Cursor AI's philosophy is that it can't be an extension because it needs to be tightly integrated with the IDE for the maximum AI analysis and generation.

Both have free tiers which is just some quota before you run out and can't generate more code or autocompletions.
