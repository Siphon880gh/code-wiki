Cursor Chat prompt 1:
```
@codebase   
Please enrich with JSDocs comments
```

Cursor Chat prompt 2 (same chat):
```
Great. Lets generate a README that onboards a new developer to the code discussing the organization of the code and the business logic. It should also discuss the frontend. To aid understanding, it may cover user stories and correlate it to the frontend and backend code as the user performs tasks. It may contain small guides for the developer to know where to plug in their code to enrich certain parts of the app.
```

Prompt 3 (same chat):
```
Is there more we should add to help onboard the developer?
```

Prompt 1 guarantees more context for documentation by having JSDoc comments. Prompt 2 and prompt 3 makes a more complete documentation.
