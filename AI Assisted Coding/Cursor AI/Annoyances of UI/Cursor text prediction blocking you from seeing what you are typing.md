Problem: Cursor text prediction blocking you from seeing what you are typing

Turn it off temporarily at the bottom right:

Alternately, you can press Escape key each time it blocks you. It may repeatedly block you as you're editing the line, needing multiple Escape hits.

Or the likely scenario is you're not in word wrap, so Cursor AI keeps forgetting if you want to ignore the suggestions as you scroll right. Word wrap can be toggled on and off easily with OPT+Z.
