Problem: Generates readme that could not be escaped in the explanation, preventing apply code because chat breaks

Looks like this:

Just prompt with:
```
I dont see the files you created
```

If that doesn't work, use this prompt:
```
I dont see the files you created. No need to explain. Just fix it
```

This will prioritize making sure the files are created/amended and will bypass explaining.
