Finding the code you forgot

Situation: Say you have an app that has nested `<ul>`  and `<li>`  that are collapsible and expandable. They could be a hierarchy of coding notes. Say you take a random li, you want to expand all the lists so it can be displayed. You don't remember where you had that code  because your codebase is huge.

Just **prompt**:
@codebase where in our code does opening a note will open up all the li collapsible up to root
