Cursor AI is an IDE based on VS Code and its AI analytic and generative features are tightly integrated into the IDE  

Learning objectives to use Cursor AI in any meaningful sense:
- Learn how to navigate basic code editing and file management (VS Code Basics)
- Learn how to navigate the different prompt interfaces, especially by using shortcut keys
	- Hint: CMD L/I/K for file prompt, composer prompt (all codebase), and inline prompt.
	- If you're curious about CMD+J, that's to open the terminal. It's the LIJK gamer right hand keys.
- Learn the prompt techniques to fix bugs, implement features, or generate starter code
- Learn how to provide context by tagging: file, files,  codebase
- Learn how to augment the AI with online documentation
