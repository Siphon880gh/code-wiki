When inline prompting, CMD+K.
- Think as Code/Kode generation

When want to chat about a file that's currently opened, CMD+L:
- Think as chat paneL

When want to create and edit code across multiple files (codebase) in Composer Mode, CMD+I
- Think the key I is above K and L, and supersedes in hierarchy because it's all the files


But really, those three keys are because J K L I makes up the gamer keys on the right side.
