DEFAULT COMPONENTS
import { Text, StyleSheet, Pressable } from 'react-native';

https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis


Note there are other UI libraries that have a better substitute for those components, and then it's a matter of importing from them instead of from 'react-native' at the top of the file.
