Expo to start, manage, and deploy

There's React-Native (the cli is `react-native` or `npx react-native`). That's largely been superseded by installing expo to manage react-native. You install expo and it'll install react-native.

Another reason for Expo: The Expo team works closely with the React Native team at Meta to bring the latest React Native features to the Expo SDK.
