In React Navigation, a **stack navigator**, mimics the stack data structure from computer science. When you navigate to a new screen, it's "pushed" onto the stack, and when you go back, the current screen is "popped" off the stack, and the phone shows an animation getting rid of the current screen to go back to a previous screen. This allows the user to go back to the previous screen, but not forward again unless you explicitly navigate to the next screen again via a link, etc.

If you want a navigation pattern that allows for both forward and backward navigation, you might consider using a **tab navigator** or a **drawer navigator**, which lets users switch between screens more freely, including moving "forward" to a screen that they have navigated away from without "popping" it off the stack.

### **Stack Navigator**:

- Automatically when you navigate to different route-screen pairs defined in the stack navigator, your app keeps a history of them. When the user gestures with a swipe, the phone shows an animation getting rid of the current screen to unwind (aka pop off) to the previous screen. The user may keep repeating this swipe gesture until they return to the first route-screen they ever navigated to that's in the current stack navigator.
- When the code navigates to a screen that already exists in the history stack, all screens ahead of that existing screen will be dropped in the history. The app reverts to that existing screen.

### **Tab Navigator**:

   - A tab navigator displays a set of tabs at the bottom (or top) of the screen, allowing users to navigate to a new screen by clicking a tab.
   - There are two types of Tab Navigators in React Native: iOS style and Android material ui style. The Android style is positioned as a top tab bar and allows the user to switch between different screens freely by swiping left and right. The iOS style is positioned as a bottom tab bar and the user is unable to swipe to switch between tabs. Even though creating Tab Navigator with its tabs and corresponding screens looks like a similar syntax to Stack Navigator (For either case: Var.Navigator>Var.Screen\*N), the Tab Navigator is not a **Stack** Navigator that remembers the order in which you opened the screens - they just both happen to involve navigation and screens.

### **Drawer Navigator**:

   - A drawer navigator provides a hidden navigation menu that slides out from the side, allowing users to navigate between screens freely.


###  **Gesture-based Navigation (Android Back/Forward Swipe)**:

   - On iOS, the stack navigator supports the swipe-to-go-back gesture by default. However, there is no built-in forward swipe gesture to navigate forward through the stack. You would need to manually implement such functionality using a combination of state management and navigation actions.
