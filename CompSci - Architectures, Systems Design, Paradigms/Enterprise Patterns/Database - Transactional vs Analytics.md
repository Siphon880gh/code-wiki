OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) are two types of data processing systems that are used for different purposes within an organization.

OLTP usually used by your clients, rather it's a business in the B2B or a consumer. Analytics are inhoused.

You usually use a combination of them


**OLTP:**

- OLTP systems are designed to manage transaction-oriented applications typically for data entry and retrieval transaction processing.
- The main focus is on efficiency in handling large numbers of transactions, which are often short and fast.
- Data is organized to avoid redundancy and to optimize for fast insert/update operations.
- OLTP databases are highly normalized.
- Typical operations involve INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT statements.
- The systems are designed to provide quick response times and to ensure data integrity and consistency during transactions.
- Examples include retail sales, banking, order entry, and any other system that requires dealing with a large number of transactions.

**OLAP:**

- OLAP systems are designed for querying and reporting, particularly for complex analytical calculations.
- They are optimized for read-heavy operations and are typically used for data mining and complex queries involving aggregations (like sum, average, etc.).
- Data is often denormalized for faster query processing, leading to redundancy but quicker retrieval.
- OLAP databases use a multidimensional data model, making it easier to analyze complex data relationships.
- Typical operations involve SELECT statements that aggregate, summarize, compare, and evaluate data.
- The systems are designed to answer ad hoc queries and can scan millions of rows quickly.
- Examples include financial reporting, forecasting, market research, and any scenario where data analysis provides insights into business trends.

OLTP is about transactional support and immediate query processing, while OLAP is about historical data analysis and decision support. In practice, many businesses use both types of systems: OLTP for daily operations and OLAP for strategic planning and data analysis.
