Docker itself doesn't create microservices; rather, it is a platform that enables you to containerize and run microservices in a consistent and isolated environment. A microservice architecture is a design approach where a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components (services).

Here's a simplified example to illustrate how Docker can be used with microservices:

Imagine you have an e-commerce application split into three microservices:

1. **Product Service**: Manages product information and inventory.
2. **Order Service**: Handles customer orders.
3. **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication.

Each of these microservices can be developed using different technology stacks that are best suited for their respective responsibilities. For instance:

- Product Service might be a Node.js application.
- Order Service might be written in Python with Flask.
- User Service could be a Java Spring Boot application.

With Docker, you can containerize each service separately. For each microservice, you would create a `Dockerfile` that defines the environment, dependencies, and how the service should run. Here's a very basic example of what a `Dockerfile` might look like for the Product Service:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js 16 image as a parent image
FROM node:16

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in package.json
RUN npm install

# Make port 3000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the app when the container launches
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

You would have similar `Dockerfile`s for the Order Service and User Service, each tailored to their respective languages and dependencies.

After writing Dockerfiles for each service, you would build Docker images:

```sh
docker build -t product-service .
docker build -t order-service .
docker build -t user-service .
```

And run each service in a separate container:

```sh
docker run -d -p 3001:3000 product-service
docker run -d -p 3002:3000 order-service
docker run -d -p 3003:3000 user-service
```

In this example, each service is mapped to a different port on the host machine.

In a real-world scenario, you would also have a reverse proxy or an API gateway in front of these services to route requests to the appropriate service, and you might use Docker Compose or an orchestration tool like Kubernetes to manage the deployment and networking of these containers.

This example is simplified for illustration purposes. Real-world microservices would include considerations for database connections, inter-service communication, configuration management, service discovery, and other factors. Docker helps manage the deployment and runtime aspects of these services, but the actual creation of the microservice architecture is up to the developers and the design of the application.
