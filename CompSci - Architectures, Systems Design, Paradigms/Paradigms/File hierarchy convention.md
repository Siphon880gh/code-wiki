# File hierarchy

For files:
```
./lib
./assets/js ...
./utils
./src
./dist
./public
```

Some rules:
- lib is classes. notice singular.
- dist is interchangeable with public, but dist more specifically is what's compiled from src.

But every dev team have their own ideas what these folders designate.
