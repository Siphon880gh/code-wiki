OS: CentOS is a popular operating system for web servers and provides a stable and secure environment for hosting websites.

Web server: Once you have CentOS 9 installed on your VPS, you can use various web server software like Apache or Nginx to host your website. 

Web Host Panel: Additionally, you can install a control panel like cPanel, DirectAdmin, etc to simplify the management of your website and server. Some require a monthly fee license. Not having a webhost panel means having to run terminal commands and editing files to add websites, ftp users, etc and is not productive.
