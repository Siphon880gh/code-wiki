FTP clients uploading many files and folders take a long time. Instead you should zip the entire folder then upload that one file, then extract with SSH terminal access.

However this presents another problem of the archiving including the .git folder which slows down archiving considerably. The solution is to exclude .git folders recursively.

Archiving excluding .git recursively:
```
COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar --exclude='*/.git' --exclude='*/node_modules' -czvf archive_name.tar.gz path/to/myfolder
```

Unarchiving:
```
tar -xzvf archive_name.tar.gz
```

## Troubleshooting - Extra \_ files after unarchiving

COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 didn't work then. Look at OS' way to do it


To recursively remove all files that start with `._` in their filenames, you can use the `find` command in a Unix-based system (such as Linux or macOS). Open a terminal and run the following command:  

```sh
find /path/to/directory -name "._*" -type f -delete
```
