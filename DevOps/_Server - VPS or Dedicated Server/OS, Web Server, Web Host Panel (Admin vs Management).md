OS: CentOS is a popular operating system for web servers and provides a stable and secure environment for hosting websites.

Web server: Once you have CentOS 9 installed on your VPS, you can use various web server software like Apache or Nginx to host your website. 

Web Host Panel: Additionally, you can install a control panel like cPanel, DirectAdmin, etc to simplify the management of your website and server. Some require a monthly fee license. Not having a webhost panel means having to run terminal commands and editing files to add websites, ftp users, etc and is not productive. You can distinctively name the web host panels:
- - **Web Host Admin Panel**
    - Typically provides high-level administrative controls and configurations, including server management, security settings, and user permissions.
    - Often used by administrators or IT professionals to manage the backend infrastructure, ensuring optimal server performance, and implementing advanced configurations.
- **Web Host Management Panel**
    - Usually offers a more user-friendly interface for managing website-related tasks such as domain management, email setup, and database administration.
    - Geared towards everyday users, web developers, or site owners who need to handle routine website management activities without deep technical expertise.
