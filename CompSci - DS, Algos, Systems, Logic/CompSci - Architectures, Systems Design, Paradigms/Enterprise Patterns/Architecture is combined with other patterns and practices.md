ChatGPT explaining a specific app that we're developing that makes videos with code:

Scaling and adding complexity to your video maker to support user customizations involves a few strategies and considerations:

Database Schema Design:

Enhance your schema to include user profiles or preferences tables.
Store user-specific settings that override the default app settings when present.
Application Logic:

Modify the video maker to first check for user-specific settings before falling back on the default app settings.
Implement feature flags that can toggle new customizations or features on and off for testing or gradual rollouts.
User Interface:

Provide an interface for users to select their preferred fonts, colors, and other settings.
Implement preview functionality so users can see how their customizations will look in the final video.
Infrastructure:

As customizations increase, so might the load on your database and servers. Ensure your infrastructure can handle the increased demand.
Use caching strategies to store frequently accessed data, like popular font and color settings.
Services and Microservices:

If the video maker is part of a larger system, consider breaking it out into a microservice to handle video generation.
This isolates the video generation load and allows for independent scaling.
Content Delivery Network (CDN):

Use a CDN to serve static assets like fonts and template images, which can reduce load times for users and decrease server load.
User Feedback Loop:

Implement analytics and user feedback mechanisms to understand which customizations are most popular and to guide further development.
Dynamic Templating:

Create dynamic video templates that can easily adapt to various customizations without the need for manual reconfiguration.
Access Control:

Ensure that users can only access and edit their customizations with proper authentication and authorization checks.
By taking these steps, you can scale the system to handle more users, more customizations, and more complex features, while also maintaining performance and user experience.
