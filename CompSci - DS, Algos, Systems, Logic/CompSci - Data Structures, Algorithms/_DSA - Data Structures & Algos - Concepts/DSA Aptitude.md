Think in space efficiency
Because the purpose of this question is to see how you can operate with array elements and also see if you are able to handle edge cases correctly. Reverse string answer also is not space efficient, as you have to create another array, so next question from interviewer will be can you rewrite code using constant space?

think in time complexity.
