The `useMutation` hook from React Query is used to handle asynchronous mutations, such as POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests. This hook provides a mechanism to trigger a function that performs an asynchronous task and allows you to handle side effects based on the mutation's state (such as success or error).

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use `useMutation`:

1. **Import `useMutation` from React Query:** Start by importing the hook.

   ```javascript
   import { useMutation } from 'react-query';
   ```

2. **Define Your Mutation Function:** Create a function that performs the asynchronous operation. This function should return a promise.

   ```javascript
   const addTodo = async (newTodo) => {
     const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/todos', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       },
       body: JSON.stringify(newTodo),
     });

     if (!response.ok) {
       throw new Error('Failed to add todo');
     }

     return response.json();
   };
   ```

3. **Use the `useMutation` Hook in Your Component:** Inside your component, call `useMutation` and pass the mutation function. `useMutation` returns an object with properties and methods you can use to interact with the mutation.

   ```jsx
   function AddTodoComponent() {
     const { mutate, isLoading, isError, error, data } = useMutation(addTodo);

     const handleSubmit = (newTodo) => {
       mutate(newTodo);
     };

     if (isLoading) {
       return <div>Adding todo...</div>;
     }

     if (isError) {
       return <div>An error occurred: {error.message}</div>;
     }

     if (data) {
       return <div>Todo added successfully!</div>;
     }

     return (
       <form onSubmit={() => handleSubmit({ text: 'Learn React Query' })}>
         <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
       </form>
     );
   }
   ```

Here's what each part of `useMutation` provides:

- **`mutate`:** A function that you can call to trigger the mutation. You pass it the variables needed for your mutation function.
- **`isLoading`:** A boolean that indicates whether the mutation is in progress.
- **`isError`:** A boolean that indicates whether the mutation encountered an error.
- **`error`:** The error object if an error occurred during the mutation.
- **`data`:** The data returned from the mutation once it is successful.

You can also use additional callbacks like `onSuccess`, `onError`, and `onSettled` to perform actions based on the mutation's outcome:

```javascript
const mutation = useMutation(addTodo, {
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    // Called if the mutation is successful
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    // Called if there is an error in the mutation
  },
  onSettled: (data, error) => {
    // Called after the mutation is either succeeded or failed
  },
});
```

By utilizing `useMutation`, you can effectively manage the lifecycle and side effects of asynchronous mutations in your React components.
