Was an old trend in image galleries that show one image at a time, and arrows on the sides are for the  user to cycle through images. Those were either normal arrows or double angle quotes or single angle quotes


It seems you're referring to a specific type of quotation mark. The characters you mentioned, « and », are known as guillemets or angle quotes, and they are used in some languages (like French) as quotation marks. The single version of these would be ‹ and ›. They are less common than the double guillemets but serve a similar purpose in denoting quoted text.
In English and many other languages, single quotation marks are typically the apostrophe-like characters: ‘ and ’. These are used for quotes within quotes, as well as occasionally for titles of certain works or to denote special meanings.
If you're referring to another specific symbol, please clarify, and I'll provide more information on that!
