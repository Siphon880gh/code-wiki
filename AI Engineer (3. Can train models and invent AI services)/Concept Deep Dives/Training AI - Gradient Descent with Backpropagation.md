During training, the model uses an optimization algorithm like gradient descent to move "downhill" on the loss surface. The goal is to reach the point with the lowest possible loss (the global minimum).

**Gradient descent** uses **backpropagation**, the algorithm responsible for calculating the **gradients** (i.e., the partial derivatives) of the loss function with respect to each parameter (weights and biases) in the network. It propagates the error backwards through the layers back to the input layer of the network to understand how much each weight and bias contributed to the overall error. To compute these gradients efficiently for each layer, the algorithm uses the chain rule of calculus. Then, the gradient descent uses these gradients to update parameters (weights, biases) in the direction that reduces the loss at each layer.

Reworded:
**Backpropagation** goes back through the layers of the neural network, from the output layer toward the input layer, updating the model’s weights and biases. It essentially "propagates" the error (or loss) backward through the network, layer by layer, using the **chain rule of calculus** to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.

Here’s the process broken down:
### 1. **Forward Pass**:
- The input data is passed through the network from the input layer to the output layer.
- Each layer processes the data by applying weights, biases, and an activation function, generating an output.
- Once the data reaches the output layer, the model produces a prediction (e.g., classifying an image as "cat" or "dog").
- The error (loss) is then computed by comparing the prediction with the true label using a **loss function** (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy).

### 2. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**:
- After computing the error at the output layer, backpropagation starts at the **output layer** and moves **backward** through the network, layer by layer, until it reaches the **input layer**.
- At each layer, it computes the **gradients** of the loss with respect to the weights and biases, using the **chain rule**. The gradients show how much the loss would change if the weights or biases were adjusted slightly.
  
  **Chain Rule**: The key concept behind backpropagation is the chain rule, which calculates how the error at the output propagates through the network and affects each weight. The gradient at each layer depends on the gradient of the layer that follows it.

### 3. **Updating the Weights**:
- Once the gradients for each layer are calculated, the weights and biases are updated using an optimization algorithm, such as **gradient descent**.
- This process adjusts the weights and biases to reduce the error for future predictions.

### How Backpropagation Works Through Layers:
- **Output Layer**: Backpropagation starts by calculating the error at the output layer, where the difference between the predicted value and the actual value is largest and most easily identifiable. The gradient of the loss with respect to the output is computed, which is the starting point for calculating how the weights and biases need to be adjusted.
  
- **Hidden Layers**: The error is then propagated backward through the hidden layers. For each hidden layer, the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases are calculated based on the gradients of the layer that follows it (the output of the next layer). This is done using the chain rule. Each layer receives some portion of the error based on how much it contributed to the overall loss.

- **Input Layer**: The process continues until it reaches the input layer, though no updates happen at the input layer itself (since it doesn't have weights). The input layer just passes the data forward.

### Backpropagation in Detail (Layer by Layer):
For each layer:
1. **Compute Gradients**: Calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases by applying the chain rule. The gradient of the loss at each layer depends on the output of the previous layer and the gradients passed from the next layer.
   
2. **Update Weights**: Once the gradients are calculated, the weights are adjusted using an optimization algorithm (like gradient descent) to reduce the error.

3. **Move to the Previous Layer**: The process repeats for the previous layer, continuing until backpropagation has gone through all the layers from output to input.

### Why Backpropagation Goes Backward:
- **Error Attribution**: The reason for propagating the error backward is to figure out how much each weight and bias in the network contributed to the final error. By moving backward through the network, you can calculate how much each neuron in each layer contributed to the prediction error, allowing the model to adjust each weight appropriately.

- **Chain Rule**: Each neuron’s output is dependent on the neurons from the previous layer, which means that the error at the output layer can be traced back through the hidden layers to understand how each weight influenced the overall prediction. The chain rule of calculus allows us to compute these dependencies and distribute the error backward.

### Summary:
- **Backpropagation** starts at the output layer and goes backward through the layers to the input layer.
- At each layer, the algorithm calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases.
- Using these gradients, the weights and biases are updated to reduce the error in future predictions.
- This backward pass ensures that the model learns how to adjust its parameters in all layers, improving its ability to make accurate predictions.

Backpropagation is essential because it ensures that the entire network (not just the output layer) learns to make better predictions, by carefully adjusting the parameters across all the layers based on the errors in the final output.
