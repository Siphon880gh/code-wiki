## Model parameter size

To run AI on your computer, you must have a powerful computer. There are always the 8B models, however they have low accuracy. From there, the model choices scale up quickly to 11B, 70B, 90B, 405B. 

Mobile is 1B and 3B, however more inaccurate.

Those parameters are how much weight and biases are allowed which allows the model to understand the world when relating different tokens to each other.

Another limiting factor is whether you have a GPU chip and what kind. That's going to determine what you type into PyTorch or Tensorflow to select the correct device and algorithm to run the AI training or AI inferencing on. It could range from slow to out of memory, if you choose incorrectly. The next section is guidelines on selecting device for AI

Your explanation on selecting the device for AI computations is overall accurate, but it could be further clarified in a few areas. Here's a more refined version, with minor corrections and better flow for readability:

## **Guidelines on Selecting a Device for AI Processing**

When running an AI model, the device used for computation can significantly impact performance. This decision involves determining whether to use the CPU, GPU, or specialized hardware, such as Apple Silicon. Additionally, if you're working with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the model may also load data from a vector database (e.g., PDFs, text files).

### MacBook Pro M1 Chips (shared CPU and GPU)
- **Apple M1 Chip**: The M1 chip integrates both CPU and GPU into the same system-on-chip (SoC), providing efficient shared memory for computational tasks.
- **Metal API**: Apple's high-performance graphics API (Metal) allows direct GPU access for computation and rendering tasks, replacing the deprecated OpenCL.
- **No OpenCL Support**: OpenCL is not recommended for new projects on Apple Silicon. Instead, Metal is the preferred API for AI and graphics processing on Mac.

### Windows with an NVIDIA GPU
- **CUDA**: If you have an NVIDIA GPU, use CUDA, NVIDIA’s parallel computing platform, which is highly optimized for AI tasks. CUDA accelerates deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **DirectML**: Although CUDA is preferred for NVIDIA GPUs, DirectML is available for general-purpose machine learning but may be less efficient.

### Windows with an AMD GPU
- **DirectML**: TensorFlow supports running on AMD GPUs through DirectML, a technology that leverages DirectX 12 for machine learning.
- **ROCm Toolkit**: For deep learning tasks, the ROCm toolkit can enable GPU acceleration on AMD hardware, allowing frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to utilize the AMD GPU more effectively.

### Windows with an Intel GPU
- **Intel oneAPI**: Intel’s oneAPI provides a unified programming model for CPUs and GPUs, which can be used to accelerate AI workloads on Intel hardware (integrated or discrete GPUs).
- **DirectML**: Intel GPUs can also benefit from DirectML to accelerate machine learning models.

### Windows without an NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel GPU
- **CPU Fallback**: When no supported GPU is available, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch can automatically fall back to using the CPU for computations.

### Example Code to Select Devices

#### **PyTorch** (Does not support DirectML or OpenCL)
```python
# Fallback to CPU if CUDA or xpu (Intel oneAPI) is not available
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'xpu' if torch.xpu.is_available() else 'cpu')
```

#### **TensorFlow** (Supports DirectML)
```python
# Check if any GPU with DirectML is available
physical_devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if physical_devices:
    print("Using GPU with DirectML")
    device_name = '/GPU:0'  # Use the first GPU
else:
    print("Using CPU")
    device_name = '/CPU:0'  # Fallback to CPU
```
