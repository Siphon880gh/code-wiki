Error:
`let url = URL(string: urlRaw)!` complains about nil. It's just incorrect URL formatting, but XCode doesn't have the right error messages to let you know.

-=

The error you're encountering in Xcode when using `let url = URL(string: urlRaw)!` is related to Swift's handling of optional values. The initializer `URL(string:)` is failable, meaning it returns an optional `URL?`. If the string you provide is not a valid URL, the initializer will return `nil`.

When you use the force unwrap operator (`!`) on the result, you're telling Swift that you're confident the operation will not produce `nil`. If it does return `nil` (due to an incorrect URL format in this case), your app will crash at runtime with a nil unwrapping error.

Xcode doesn't specifically tell you that the URL formatting is incorrect because, from the compiler's perspective, it's just dealing with optionals and their unwrapping. It's the developer's responsibility to ensure that the string being passed can be successfully turned into a URL.

To handle this more safely, you should avoid force unwrapping and instead use optional binding (`if let`) or `guard let` to safely unwrap the optional URL:

```swift
if let url = URL(string: urlRaw) {
    // Use `url` here, safe in the knowledge that it's not nil
} else {
    // Handle the error case where the URL could not be created.
    // This is where you'd deal with the possibility of incorrect URL formatting.
}
```

Using this approach, you can provide more specific error handling and avoid a runtime crash if the URL is not formatted correctly.
