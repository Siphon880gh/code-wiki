No keyboard screen on iOS simulator?
Is not your code. It was SHIFT+CMD+K that turned off the simulator keyboard and connected simulator input to your actual keyboard. Somehow Shift+CMD+K was triggered. Pressing CMD+K (without Shift) disconnects the actual keyboard and re-added simulator screen keyboard.
