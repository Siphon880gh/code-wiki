  

End-to-end testing involves evaluating the complete flow of an application, from start to finish, to ensure that all integrated components work together as expected. This type of testing is particularly important in complex software environments where multiple systems interact with each other. The goal is to identify and resolve any issues that arise when individual components that may work fine in isolation are combined into the full application workflow.  

  

End-to-end testing is essential as modern software has grown to be intricate with dozens of systems interacting with each other simultaneously. Even if these components function perfectly fine individually, they may still fail when integrated due to the miscommunication between components. End to end testing is there to verify the flow of information through the AUT, including all possible paths and dependencies. If there is an issue in any “touchpoint” between software components and/or subsystems, testers can easily locate the root cause and troubleshoot immediately.

"AUT" stands for "Application Under Test." This term refers to the specific software application or system that is being tested.
