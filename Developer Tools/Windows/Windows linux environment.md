For Windows, you may want to install Cygwin or Git Bash so you can take advantage of Git, node, npm, and much of the Linux commands that developers agree to use.
Note: Git Bash is a package that installs Bash, some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system.

You also may want SSH access to your servers. On Windows, there is PuTTY for that.

Macs has the developer advantage of an Unix terminal that has all this built in.
