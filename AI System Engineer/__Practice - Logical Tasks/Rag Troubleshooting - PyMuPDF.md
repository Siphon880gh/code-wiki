If you get an error about PyMuPDF module not found... that shouldn’t be the case. It’s likely another python version is overriding the poetry’s python. So the python version that doesn’t have PyMuPDF is interpretting the script which tries to import PyMuPDF

See if the path to the poetry python is before other python versions because python will be found from left to right from first entry to final entry (`poetry env list` to get a hint whats the folder name called). Run this to see path:
```
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

Add and make sure it’s the final PYTHONPATH if any exists at your .bash_profile, .zsrc, etc. Please adjust X.Y to the version number you saw from syst.path:
```
# Poetry  
if command -v poetry &> /dev/null  
then  
        export PYTHONPATH=$(poetry env info --path)/lib/python3.10/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH  
fi
```

Exit and go back into then try poetry shell (Sourcing doesnt work)

You can confirm with above sys.path printing command and/or `pip show PyMuPDF`  to see if pip sees the file


Try ingest.py script or whatever script is analyzing your PDF again. if fails, the problem may be with the pymupdf installation. 

Unfortunately it’s a poor experience with them. import fitz which is pymupdf with (Namesake https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#note-on-the-name-fitz):
```
python -c "import fitz"
```

It may give you an error about “but is an incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64’))” or any architecture problems

Installing the `.whl` file directly can sometimes be necessary, especially for platform-specific dependencies like PyMuPDF. PyMuPDF (also known as `fitz`), which extracts information from PDF files, needs to be platform-specific mainly due to how it interacts with system-level libraries and optimizations. Ideally when you installed PyMuPDF, it should compile from the source code into the appropriate whl file based on your architecture, but since that didn’t happen, you can download the .whl file specific to your platform instead.

Reworded: Someone explaining the platform specific .whl files:
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68644003/pymupdf-modulenotfounderror#answer-68837200](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68644003/pymupdf-modulenotfounderror#answer-68837200)  

Go here to download the .whl specific to your platform and chip
[https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/#files](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/#files)  

- For example Apple _M1_ was a series of _ARM_-based system-on-a-chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc., launched 2020 to 2022. It was part of the Apple silicon series, ...

With the .whl file in the app’s folder, then run pip in the app’s folder like this in order to install from the compiled .whl file:

```
pip install PyMuPDF-<...>.whl
```

Eg.
```
pip install PyMuPDF-1.24.11-cp38-abi3-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl
```

If you're running the scripts with Poetry, make sure the above installing the .whl file is installed inside the poetry shell

Then test again no problems (if no message back, it’s a pass and your scripts should be able to use PyMuPDF)
```
python -c "import fitz"
```

Reworded:

You can quickly test it works by running `import fitz` because it gives better errors. Fitz comes with PyMuPDF and is the fall back when MuPDF fails. 
- If it gives errors about architecture, then that means you should install from the .whl file according to your cpu architecture and os platform. You would download from https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/#files, and download the appropriate .whl file named arm64, x86_64, linux, windows, or amd64. 
- You would then install from the compiled .whl file like this: `pip install ...whl` (as a review, .whl is the final binary of the Python package, thinking back to a cheese wheel that can be easily distributed, like with pip - Python has a lot of Monty Python jokes).
