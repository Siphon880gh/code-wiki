BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is considered a large language model (LLM), though it differs in purpose and architecture from some of the more recent and popular LLMs like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models.

BERT is a transformer-based model designed for understanding the context of words in sentences (i.e., it excels at tasks like question answering, sentence classification, and sentence pair tasks). Unlike models like GPT, which are primarily used for generating text, BERT is used for understanding and extracting meaning from text through tasks like:

- Text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis)
- Named entity recognition (NER)
- Question answering (extracting answers from text)

BERT's "bidirectional" nature means it looks at both the left and right context of a word in a sentence to understand meaning, while earlier models often only looked at the words preceding the target word.

However, newer large language models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLaMA are more focused on text generation and are trained on much larger datasets with more complex training paradigms, pushing the boundaries of what we consider LLMs today.
