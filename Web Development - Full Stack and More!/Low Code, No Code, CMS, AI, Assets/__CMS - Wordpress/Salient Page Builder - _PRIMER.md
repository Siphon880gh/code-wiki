**Salient?**
Salient theme has a couple site builders and site building features
- Salient site builder (Frontend button) but it's locked into their own system. 
- WP Bakery that they bundled in is enhanced and doesn't lock you into their own system. 
- Nectar shortcodes button that opens a library of elements and layouts, then selecting a nectar shortcode opens a wizard of options to configure, and when finalized, inserts a shortcode. This is accessible in the Backend Editor of the enhanced WP Bakery

To compare with other site builders, see: [[Wordpress Site Builders]]

**Where are we:**
You're editing a page because you went from the left sidebar Pages -> Editing a specific page

You can switch between Backend and Classic Mode by clicking the toggle mode button (first button) - These are part of the enhanced WPBakery Page Builder. For explanations of Backend and Classic Mode, refer to [[WPBakery Page Builder - _PRIMER - Backend, Classic, Frontend, Visual, Text]]

What's the second button "Frontend editor"? That's the theme's website builder, eg. Salient's website builder.
