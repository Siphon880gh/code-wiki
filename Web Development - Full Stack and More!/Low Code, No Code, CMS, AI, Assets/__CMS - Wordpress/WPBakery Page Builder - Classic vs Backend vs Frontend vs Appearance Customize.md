- Frontend vs Backend vs Classic examples here are from a Salient Theme.
- Appearance -> Customize example is from Elementor Theme but is the same way in Salient Theme

## Frontend mode

Wordpress Frontend is like having access to how the website looks more accurately when live by having the same proportion, showing the texts, images, etc. Hovering your mouse still lets you edit your blocks.
## Backend mode

Wordpress backend is like laying out the bricks of your website. You can more easily see how the elements are arranged and move them around

## Classic Mode
Classic Mode allows you to fine tune the layout and design with the shortcodes of WPBakery (AKA VIsual Composer) which is the backbone of Salient theme's site builder

Refer to [[WPBakery Page Builder - Classic Mode (With Visual and Text Sub-modes)]]


## Main Builder ("Edit with WPBakery Page Builder")
