## Salient
Salient theme has a couple site builders and site building features
- Salient site builder (Frontend button) but it's locked into their own system. 
- WP Bakery that they bundled in is enhanced and doesn't lock you into their own system. 
- Nectar shortcodes button that opens a library of elements and layouts, then selecting a nectar shortcode opens a wizard of options to configure, and when finalized, inserts a shortcode. This is accessible in the Backend Editor of the enhanced WP Bakery

## WPBakery (Formerly Visual Composer)
Has Classic Editor and Backend Editor. Easy and intuitive to use. Longer update cycles. WPBakery promises to work with any theme because it's not locked into their own system. As of 10/2024, it's $69 for lifetime. https://wpbakery.com/features/work-with-any-wordpress-theme/
Btw, WPBakery was formerly known as Visual Composer but had to change their names for legal reasons - and which is why shortcodes are preceded "vc_"
## Elementor
It has its own editor. Higher quality looking sites can be built than Salient or WPBakery. But while Elementor has shorter update cycles, their updates often break the PHP website.

## Nectarblock
Nectarblock theme that includes the Nectarblock site editor. Enhances the Appearance editor. From the same people of Salient, this newer product line promises high quality websites, producing websites similar to Apple.com with scroll triggered effects and visual touches to elements and layouts that are industry trending.

## Gutenberg
Default wordpress' site builder. It's considered dated.
